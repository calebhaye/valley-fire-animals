  <h1>About Valley Fire Lost & Found Animals</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
  This web site was created in response to the devastating Valley
  Fire, which started in Lake County, CA in 2015.  Its goal is to
  reunite owners and their pets or animals that were separated in
  the chaos of the rapidly spreading fire.

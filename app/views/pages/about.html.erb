  <h1>About Valley Fire Lost & Found Animals</h1>
</div>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
  This web site was created in response to the devastating Valley
  Fire, which started in Lake County, CA in 2015.  Its goal is to
  reunite owners and their pets or animals that were separated in
  the chaos of the rapidly spreading fire.

    <td>
      Aaron here, filling in for Marcel over the weekend.  There's been
      some confusion resulting from our new feature to mark animals and
      owners as reunited. I'm fixing false reports as quickly as I can.
      If you see an animal marked as reunited that's not, please let us
      know and I'll fix ASAP. In the meantime, I made a few changes to
      the process to hopefully reduce false reports.
